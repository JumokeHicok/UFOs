# UFOs

## Project Overview
Edit the javascript code to allow the user to filter the web page on the following criteria:
1. Date
2. City
3. State
4. Country
5. Shape

## Results
##### Here are the steps for using the search criteria on the web page:

- Scan through the data to get an idea of what you are searching through and what values are used for each criteria.
- Add a value to any of the fields and hit enter or move the curser out of the box to filter the data.
    - You will see example formatting in each of the search fields.
- Add a value to the other fields if you would like to filter even further.
- To unfilter the date do one of the following:
    - Delete all of the values
    - Refresh the web page
    - Click the button at the top left labeled "UFO Sightings"

##### Example using one filter:
![Date Filter](/static/images/date.png)

##### Example using two filters:
![Date and State](/static/images/date_state.png)


## Challenge Summary
One drawback to this website is that the formatting of the search values are very specific.  If the user typed 01/06/2010 instead of 1/6/2010 they would not get any results yet.

One thing that could be done to improve the site is to include drop boxes in the search fields so the user can select values that way instead of manually entering.  Another recommendation would be to fix the code so that the criteria fields are not case sensitive.
